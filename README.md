# Distributed-system-pro1
Java

This is the project1 of Distributed system in Uni Melbourne

The basic components are the File System Manager that monitors a given directory in the file system on a local machine, 
for changes to files, etc., and a BitBox Peer that can "relay" these changes to another BitBox Peer on a remote machine.
