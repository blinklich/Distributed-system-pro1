# Distributed-system-pro1
This project was writen in Java

This is the project1 of Distributed system in Uni Melbourne, Unstructured P2P Network

The basic components are the File System Manager that monitors a given directory in the file system on a local machine, 
for changes to files, etc., and a BitBox Peer that can "relay" these changes to another BitBox Peer on a remote machine.


Allow the BitBox Peers to form an unstructured P2P network. By unstructured we mean that the connection pattern has no relevance to the functionality, and is somewhat arbitrary depending on how and when peers come and go.
